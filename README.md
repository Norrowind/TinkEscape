# TinkEscape
My first project which has been done in 03.19. In this project i have made droid prototype with some features. BuildingGun:building shot - which buid platform(LMB) and use building energy, "consume" shot(RMB) that consume platform and restore building energy.KineticGun: Kinetic shot which fires impulse(LMB) and uses kinetick energy, gravity-on/off shot(RMB). With E and Q keys player can change gun. Also droid can do power-up jump with spacebar holding.
All assets has been got from open sorces:
